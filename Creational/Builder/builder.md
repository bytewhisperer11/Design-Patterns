# Builder Pattern

## Definition  
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful for creating objects with numerous optional parameters or configurations.

## Intent  
- To simplify the creation of complex objects by breaking down the construction process into manageable steps.  
- To provide a clear and flexible way to construct objects with varying configurations.

## Problem  
- You need to create an object that requires a large number of parameters, some of which are optional, leading to constructor overloads or unclear code.  
- The object’s creation process involves multiple steps, making it difficult to read or maintain.

## Solution  
- Use a `Builder` class to encapsulate the construction logic and maintain the state of the object being built.  
- Separate the object’s construction from its final representation by letting the `Builder` handle the step-by-step assembly process.  
- Ensure that the `Builder` provides methods to set individual properties or configurations, and a `build()` method to return the constructed object.

## Key Components  
- **Builder Interface:** Defines the steps required to construct the object.  
- **Concrete Builder:** Implements the `Builder` interface and provides the logic for constructing and assembling parts of the product.  
- **Product:** The complex object being constructed.  
- **Director (Optional):** Oversees the construction process and enforces a specific order of construction steps.

## When to Use  
- When the object being constructed has many parameters, especially optional ones, leading to readability and maintainability issues.  
- When the construction process involves several steps that need to be executed in a specific sequence.  
- When you want to create different representations of the same object.

## Benefits  
- **Improved Readability:** The construction process is broken into clear, logical steps.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows you to construct objects with different configurations without requiring multiple constructors.  
- **Reusability:** The `Builder` can be reused to construct objects with varying configurations.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separates the logic of building an object from its representation.

## When to Avoid  
- When the object is simple and doesn’t require a complex construction process.  
- When the construction logic doesn’t benefit from being broken down into steps, as this may add unnecessary complexity.  

## Summary  
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, making it easier to create objects with numerous parameters or configurations. It improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability by breaking the construction process into logical steps.

## What to Prepare for Interview  
- **Definition and Use Case:** Be ready to explain the Builder Pattern and provide examples of when to use it, such as constructing objects with many optional parameters (e.g., a customizable car or a configuration file).  
- **Code Example:** Prepare a simple code example demonstrating a `Builder` class and how it constructs an object step-by-step.  
- **Real-World Use Cases:** Understand real-world applications like creating complex UI components, query builders, or HTTP requests.  
- **Comparison with Other Patterns:** Be able to compare the Builder Pattern with patterns like Factory Method (which focuses on creating objects without specifying their concrete classes) or Prototype (which creates new objects by copying an existing instance).  
- **Benefits and Trade-offs:** Discuss the advantages and limitations of the Builder Pattern, such as when it’s helpful for complex object creation but unnecessary for simple cases.
